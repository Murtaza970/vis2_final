<strong> Salary and Experience</strong> <br>
    This heatmap visualizes the correlation between years of
     professional experience and average salary in different countries.
      The color intensity reflects the salary levels, with darker shades
       representing higher incomes. Notably, areas with a white background
        signify missing data for specific regions. 
        The accompanying legend provides a reference for the salary ranges
        , aiding in the interpretation of the heatmap's
         color scale and facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of the data.

<div id = vis2> 
    <strong>Salary Race and Country Scatter</strong><br>. The data reveals significant 
     disparities, with Asians generally earning the highest salaries, 
     while White individuals tend to earn the least. Notably,
      this disparity may be attributed to the fact that the dataset 
      predominantly includes information from predominantly White-majority
       countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. 
       This skewed representation in the data potentially underscores 
       disparities in income distribution due to factors like job positions and opportunities
